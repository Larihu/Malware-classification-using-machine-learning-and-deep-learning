# Malware classification using machine learning and deep learning

This repository contains the code for the paper “Analysis of malware classification using machine learning and deep learning”.

### Dataset

The dataset chosen for this study was implemented by Suleiman Yerima [1].

#### Dataset transformation

We have converted the dataset into visual features using the method called pyDeepInsight available in the repository https://github.com/alok-ai-lab/pyDeepInsight.git.

### Models implementation

VGGNet-16 classifier and models training implementation are based on the work available in the repository https://github.com/mme384/Image-Classifier-VGG16.git
